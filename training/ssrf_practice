Blind ssrf with out of band detection:
- It was in the referrer header
-- Just had to put the collaborator ip in the referrer header

SSRF with blacklist-based input filter:
- Typically these block 127.0.0.1 and localhost
-- Alternate representations of 127.0.0.1 are
--- 127.1
--- 213070643
--- 017700000001
-- You can use a domain name that resolves to 127.0.0.1
--- For the labs use spoofed.burpcollaborator.net
-- You can use url encoding or case variation
-- Provide a url that you control that redirects to their url
- This is the stock api I used to exploit: http%3A%2F%2F127.1%2FAdmin%2Fdelete?username=carlos 

SSRF via open redirect:
- Found redirection in html page source
-- Used this payload for stockapi: /product/nextProduct?path=http://192.168.0.12:8080/admin/delete?username=carlos
